#This is the configuration required to use the usergrid_ironhorse gem in rails
#We need to set the endpoint for which we'll be creating objects against
#The application_url property is formatted like so https://{usergrid endpoint}/{org-name}/{app-name}
#	usergrid endpoint => either api.usergrid.com or your custom version of usergrid
#	org-name => this is your apigee.com username!
#	app-name => this is the name of your app. We created the sandbox app for you. It's open by default
#				but don't worry apps you create won't be!
#The auth_token property is the token required by usergrid to make requests against the API.
#It can be found on the portal. For now we don't need it.
#The require_login property should be set to true if you'd like users to be authenticated with your
#service to use the app.
